Work-life balance entails to a balanced state, where one adequately balances work or professional demands and those of their personal life. An individual who lacks a work-life balance has more obligations with respect to work and home, works longer hours, and experiences shortfall in personal time.Some utilize work-life balance as an opportunity to work no more than 8 hours a day and still have time to hit the gym, run some other works, and spend time with family and friends.Here we get to se which cities best aid work-life balance.

Not maintaining proper work-life blend  can lead to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia, as well as physical health issues including chronic aches and pains, heart troubles, and hypertension. Burnout happens when an employee suffers too much stress over a long period of time.
